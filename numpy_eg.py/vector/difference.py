# 1. difference - it will subtract arr[i+1] - arr[i]

# arr = np.array([5,4,3,2,1])
# print(np.diff(arr))

# 2. difference but twice - in this whatever the new array will come,it will diff it once again

# arr = np.array([5,4,3,2,1])
# print(np.diff(arr,2))           # 2nd para is how much time we have do that task
